#### Why is Ninjabrain bot opening as a blank screen?
_This can happen when you run the program with Java 8. You can check which version of Java you're using by running `java --version` in your terminal. Try using Java 17 or higher instead._


#### Can I open Ninjabrain bot on a second monitor on Waywall?
_Currently, Ninjabrain bot doesn't work on Wayland outside of Waywall. You can open it on Waywall without toggling visibility, and use qMaxXen's [NBTrackr](https://github.com/qMaxXen/NBTrackr) on your second monitor._


#### What is Hyprmcsr?
_[Hyprmcsr](https://github.com/Relacibo/hyprmcsr) is hyprland-specific resizing tool developed entirely separately to the tools mentioned in this guide._


#### Why doesn't Jingle work?
